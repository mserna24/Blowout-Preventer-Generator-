# Blowout Preventer Generator

## Description
The purpose of the code is to create a database of various Blowout Preventers (BOP)
that are available to the Oil and Gas Industry. Currently the data is base off
Cameron blowout preventers. In the future I'm looking to include other BOPs 
from various other companies.

Currently the program is written in python. Some ideas to implement is make this 
software web base inorder to reach a high audience and recieve user input. Additionally,
I would like to change how the data is currently stored.
